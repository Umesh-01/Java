## Abstract Classes

1.1. Create a class called GeneralBank which acts as base class for all banks. This class has functionality getSavingInterestRate and getFixedInterestRate methods, which return the saving a/c rate of interest and fixed account rate of interest the specific bank gives. 
Since GeneralBank cannot say what percentage which bank would give, make it abstract.

1.2. Create 2 subclasses of GeneralBank called ICICIBank and KotMBank. Override the methods from base class. 
ICICI - Savings 4% Fixed 8.5% and KotMBank.  - Savings 6% Fixed 9%

1.3. Create a main method to test the above classes. Try one by one and absorb your finding.
- ICICIBank object reference instantiated with ICICIBank class.
- KotMBank object reference instantiated with KotMBank class.
- GeneralBank object reference instantiated with KotMBank class.
- GeneralBank object reference instantiated with ICICIBank class.
