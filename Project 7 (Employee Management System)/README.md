#### _Employee Management System_

Create a menu based Java application with the following options.
1. Add an Employee
2. Display All
3. Exit

If option 1 is selected, the application should gather details of the employee like
employee name, employee id, designation and salary and store it in a file.

If option 2 is selected, the application should display all the employee details.

If option 3 is selected the application should exit.
